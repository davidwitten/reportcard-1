About

Reportcard is a Pythonic interface to Edline that summarizes grade reports.

How to use

First, fill out edline.txt with your personal Edline data. Each entry should be on a different line, and class urls should be the address of that homepage of each class. Then just run reportcard.py (with Python 3)!
